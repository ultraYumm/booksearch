# Bookmarks React Client
_This project is a demonstration for Thinkful's React course_

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Static version
In the static version of the app the components are built without any user interaction or state.

## With State
Contains a basic state passed as props around the app. No interactivity.

## With interactivity
Event handlers are added to components and callbacks are passed via props to the components that need them.
